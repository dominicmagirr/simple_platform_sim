# simple_platform_sim
A simple simulation of a platform study to evaluate the impact of non-constant treatment effect.

The question I am interested in is: if there is no effect (B vs Control), but A vs Control has a non-constant treatment effect, how much does including the non-concurrent A vs Control data bias the B vs Control comparison?
